This repository presents the generated code and the graphic results contained in the articles "Testing Real-Time Systems from Compositional Symbolic Specifications" submitted to the Software Tools for Technology Transfer Journal (STTT) and "Testing interruptions for the tioco conformance relation" submitted to IEEE Symposium on Real-time Computing (ISORC).

Our main objectives are to allow the SYMBOLRT tool to use the sequential, parallel and interruption compositional operators. For this, we present initial results towards test case generation of the following systems already presented in our articles:

* Choose; Pay

* Mouse || Screen

* (Target Designation ; Target Tracking ) || Radar

* Mouse Interrupted /\ Reset

* Cell Phone


## GETTING STARTED

  Installing SYMBOLRT:
  - Install the dependences:
    * Install the CVC4.
    * Install Java (8.0 or above)
  - Download and run symbolrt.deb
  - Go to the root folder on OPT and run the test. Or just run the Eclipse Version.
