This repository presents the generated code and the graphic results contained in the articles "Testing Real-Time Systems from Compositional Symbolic Specifications" submitted to the Software Tools for Technology Transfer Journal (STTT) and "Testing interruptions for the tioco conformance relation" submitted to IEEE Symposium on Real-time Computing (ISORC).

Our main objectives are to allow the SYMBOLRT tool to use the sequential, parallel and interruption compositional operators. For this, we present initial results towards test case generation of the following systems already presented in our articles:
Choose; Pay
Mouse || Screen
(Target Designation ; Target Tracking ) || Radar
Mouse Interrupted /\ Reset
Cell Phone
