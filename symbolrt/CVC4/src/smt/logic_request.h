 ** \brief An object to request logic widening in the running SmtEngine
 **
 ** An object to request logic widening in the running SmtEngine.  This
 ** class exists as a proxy between theory code and the SmtEngine, allowing
 ** a theory to enable another theory in the SmtEngine after initialization
 ** (thus the usual, public setLogic() cannot be used).  This is mainly to
 ** support features like uninterpreted divide-by-zero (to support the
 ** partial function DIVISION), where during theory expansion, the theory
 ** of uninterpreted functions needs to be added to the logic to support
 ** partial functions.
