/** InstMatchGenerator class
*
* This is the default generator class for non-simple single triggers, that is,
* triggers composed of a single term with nested term applications.
* For example, { f( y, f( x, a ) ) } and { f( g( x ), a ) } are non-simple
* triggers.
*
* Handling non-simple triggers is done by constructing a linked list of
* InstMatchGenerator classes (see mkInstMatchGenerator), where each
* InstMatchGenerator has a "d_next" pointer.  If d_next is NULL,
* then this is the end of the InstMatchGenerator and the last
* InstMatchGenerator is responsible for finalizing the instantiation.
*
* For (EX1), for the trigger f( y, f( x, a ) ), we construct the linked list:
*
* [ f( y, f( x, a ) ) ] -> [ f( x, a ) ] -> NULL
*
* In a call to getNextMatch,
* if we match against a ground term f( b, c ), then the first InstMatchGenerator
* in this list binds y to b, and tells the InstMatchGenerator [ f( x, a ) ] to
* match f-applications in the equivalence class of c.
*
* CVC4 employs techniques that ensure that the number of instantiations
* is worst-case polynomial wrt the number of ground terms.
* Consider the axiom/pattern/context (EX2) :
*
*          axiom : forall x1 x2 x3 x4. F[ x1...x4 ]
*
*        trigger : P( f( x1 ), f( x2 ), f( x3 ), f( x4 ) )
*
* ground context : ~P( a, a, a, a ), a = f( c_1 ) = ... = f( c_100 )
*
* If E-matching were applied exhaustively, then x1, x2, x3, x4 would be
* instantiated with all combinations of c_1, ... c_100, giving 100^4
* instantiations.
*
* Instead, we enforce that at most 1 instantiation is produced for a
* ( pattern, ground term ) pair per round. Meaning, only one instantiation is
* generated when matching P( a, a, a, a ) against the generator
* [P( f( x1 ), f( x2 ), f( x3 ), f( x4 ) )]. For details, see Section 3 of
* Reynolds, Vampire 2016.
*
* To enforce these policies, we use a flag "d_active_add" which dictates the
* behavior of the last element in the linked list. If d_active_add is
*   true -> a call to getNextMatch(...) returns 1 only if adding the
*           instantiation via a call to IMGenerator::sendInstantiation(...)
*           successfully enqueues a lemma via a call to
*           Instantiate::addInstantiation(...). This call may fail e.g. if we
*           have already added the instantiation, or the instantiation is
*           entailed.
*   false -> a call to getNextMatch(...) returns 1 whenever an m is
*            constructed, where typically the caller would use m.
* This is important since a return value >0 signals that the current matched
* terms should be flushed. Consider the above example (EX1), where
* [ f(y,f(x,a)) ] is being matched against f(b,c),
* [ f(x,a) ] is being matched against f(d,a) where c=f(d,a)
* A successfully added instantiation { x->d, y->b } here signals we should
* not produce further instantiations that match f(y,f(x,a)) with f(b,c).
*
* A number of special cases of triggers are covered by this generator (see
* implementation of initialize), including :
*   Literal triggers, e.g. x >= a, ~x = y
*   Selector triggers, e.g. head( x )
*   Triggers with invertible subterms, e.g. f( x+1 )
*   Variable triggers, e.g. x
*
* All triggers above can be in the context of an equality, e.g.
* { f( y, f( x, a ) ) = b } is a trigger that matches f( y, f( x, a ) ) to
* ground terms in the equivalence class of b.
* { ~f( y, f( x, a ) ) = b } is a trigger that matches f( y, f( x, a ) ) to any
* ground terms not in the equivalence class of b.

*
* Handling multi-triggers using this class is done by constructing a linked
* list of InstMatchGenerator classes (see mkInstMatchGeneratorMulti), with one
* InstMatchGeneratorMultiLinear at the head and a list of trailing
* InstMatchGenerators.
*
* CVC4 employs techniques that ensure that the number of instantiations
* is worst-case polynomial wrt the number of ground terms, where this class
* lifts this policy to multi-triggers. In particular consider
*
*  multi-trigger : { f( x1 ), f( x2 ), f( x3 ), f( x4 ) }
*
* For this multi-trigger, we insist that for each i=1...4, and each ground term
* t, there is at most 1 instantiation added as a result of matching
*    ( f( x1 ), f( x2 ), f( x3 ), f( x4 ) )
* against ground terms of the form
*    ( s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4 ) where t = s_i for i=1,...,4.
* Meaning we add instantiations for the multi-trigger
* ( f( x1 ), f( x2 ), f( x3 ), f( x4 ) ) based on matching pairwise against:
*   ( f( c_i11 ), f( c_i21 ), f( c_i31 ), f( c_i41 ) )
*   ( f( c_i12 ), f( c_i22 ), f( c_i32 ), f( c_i42 ) )
*   ( f( c_i13 ), f( c_i23 ), f( c_i33 ), f( c_i43 ) )
* Where we require c_i{jk} != c_i{jl} for each i=1...4, k != l.
*
* For example, we disallow adding instantiations based on matching against both
* ( f( c_1 ), f( c_2 ), f( c_4 ), f( c_6 ) ) and
* ( f( c_1 ), f( c_3 ), f( c_5 ), f( c_7 ) )
* against ( f( x1 ), f( x2 ), f( x3 ), f( x4 ) ), since f( c_1 ) is matched
* against f( x1 ) twice.

/** InstMatchGeneratorSimple class
*
* This is the default generator class for simple single triggers.
* For example, { f( x, a ) }, { f( x, x ) } and { f( x, y ) } are simple single
* triggers. In practice, around 70-90% of triggers are simple single triggers.
*
* Notice that simple triggers also can have an attached polarity.
* For example, { P( x ) = false }, { f( x, y ) = a } and { ~f( a, x ) = b } are
* simple single triggers.
*
* The implementation traverses the term indices in TermDatabase for adding
* instantiations, which is more efficient than the techniques required for
* handling non-simple single triggers.
*
* In contrast to other instantiation generators, it does not call
* IMGenerator::sendInstantiation and for performance reasons instead calls
* qe->getInstantiate()->addInstantiation(...) directly.
