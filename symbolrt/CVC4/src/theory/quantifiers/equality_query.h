/** EqualityQueryQuantifiersEngine class
 *
 * This is a wrapper class around an equality engine that is used for
 * queries required by algorithms in the quantifiers theory. It uses an equality
 * engine, as determined by the quantifiers engine it points to.
 *
 * The main extension of this class wrt EqualityQuery is the function
 * getInternalRepresentative, which is used by instantiation-based methods
 * that are agnostic with respect to choosing terms within an equivalence class.
 * Examples of such methods are finite model finding and enumerative
 * instantiation. Method getInternalRepresentative returns the "best"
 * representative based on the internal heuristic, which is currently based on
 * choosing the term that was previously chosen as a representative earliest.
